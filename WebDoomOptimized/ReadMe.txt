## Synopsis
---------------
The game code was been changed and optimized to ensure a stable framerate aroung 60 fps. For the
specific steps and individual fps gains of each step please refer to the excel file called
Pg08Hector_WebOptimization_A2 which resides in the root folder of the app.
I decided to use https://jscompress.com/ for compression and mangling, it uses UglifyJS2.
I did create and upload a script but it requires to change the local address to the uglify installation because
of installation permissions.
